== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the labels and captions? =
Go to your plugin list and scroll down until you see 'Quick Contact Form' and click on 'Settings'. Select the 'Form Settings', 'Error Messages' or 'Reply options' tabs. Change the settings and Save (quite important this last bit).

= What's the shortcode? =
[qcf]

= How do I change the colours? =
Edit the 'quick-contact-form-styles.css' or used the Custom CSS option on the plugin settings pages.

= Can I add more fields? =
No.

= Why not? =
Well OK yes you can add more fields if you want but you are going to have to fiddle about with the php file which needs a bit of care an attention. Everything you need to know is in the [wordpress codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin).

= It's all gone wrong! =
If it all goes wrong, just reinstall the plugin and start again. If you need help then [contact me](http://quick-plugins.com/contact-me/).

= Does anybody read these things? =
I did, and so have you.  Maybe there will be more, who knows.

= Have you got any pictures of cute kittens? =
No but I've inherited 2 ancient, deaf and grumpy Persians.
